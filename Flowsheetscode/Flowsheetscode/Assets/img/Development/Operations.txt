Flowsheets have staff with a total of 10 years of experience in line management of concentrator operations, followed by 34 years of technical support of projects and operations.  We have a good grasp of the challenges that face an operation.  Apart from assisting with stabilising and securing safe and reliable production, we strive to identify and pursue the next performance opportunity in the plant.

Performance opportunities may be identified by a statistical benchmark survey, or by laboratory scale flotation testing for an improved collector suite, supported by good quantitative and compositional mineralogy.

Let Flowsheets assist you with you operationsâ€¦.
